# Arrow_IntroToPython

This is the workshop plan for the Introduction to Python Workshop for the [Arrow Conference](https://www.arrownyc.org/).


## Before we begin

#### Python2 vs. Python3
Same idea, slightly different syntax for certain operations (ie: printing, division).
Python2 will no longer be maintained by 2020. Unfortunately some libraries do not support Python3
I'm teaching Python3.

#### Code editors
Atom, Sublime Text, Vim (needs some configuration), Idle, PyCharm (IDE by Jetbrains)
Free, except for PyCharm Professional Edition (luckily there's a Community Edition)
Atom, Sublime Text, and Vim go with your terminal

#### Running Python
```
$ python
```
or
```
$ python3
```
Python automatically installed with Mac. Windows does not have this.


#### Questions?
## Let's Start!

We're going to making a mini-artist look up program.
